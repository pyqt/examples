If you know HTML: Widgets are a little like HTML elements. They can be nested, and have a different appearance and behavior depending on their type. (Eg. a link `<a>` looks and behaves differently from an image `<img>`.)

Some of the widgets you can see in this screenshot are:

 * [QLabel](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qlabel.html)

 * [QSlider](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qslider.html)

The source code for this application is in [`main.py`](main.py). For instructions how to run it, please see [here](../../README.md#running-the-examples). Don't worry if you don't yet fully understand the source code. The main purpose of this example is to give you a feel for what a widget is, and which ones are available. The next examples give you a more gradual route to more advanced PyQt topics.
